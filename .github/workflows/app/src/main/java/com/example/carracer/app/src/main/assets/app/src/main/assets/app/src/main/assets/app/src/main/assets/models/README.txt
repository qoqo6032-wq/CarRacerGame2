This folder is where GLB car models go.

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to auto-download a couple of permissive sample models at build-time.
If you want premium/branded models (Bugatti, Ferrari, Lambo), download the .glb files yourself and upload them
here (name them: bugatti.glb, lamborghini.glb, ferrari.glb, porsche.glb).

If models are missing, the game uses a placeholder procedural car.
